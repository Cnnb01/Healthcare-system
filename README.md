# 🏥 Healthcare Management System

A full-stack healthcare management system built with **React (Vite)** and **Express.js**, backed by **PostgreSQL**.  
This platform is designed to streamline clinic operations by enabling receptionists to register clients and doctors to manage health programs and assign them to individual clients.
